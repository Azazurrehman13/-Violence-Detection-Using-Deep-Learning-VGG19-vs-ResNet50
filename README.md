Violence Detection in Video Frames using Deep Learning
This project uses fine-tuned deep learning models (VGG19 and ResNet50) to detect violent activities in video frames. The goal is to build a reliable and accurate system that can help identify scenes of violence in surveillance or media content.

ðŸš€ Models Used
VGG19 (Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuned)

ResNet50 (Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuned)

ðŸ§  Key Features
Frame extraction from video clips using OpenCV

Image classification pipeline using PyTorch

Comparative performance analysis (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations

Gradio-based demo interface for real-time video analysis

ðŸ“Š Results Summary
Metric	VGG19	ResNet50
Accuracy	98%	99%
F1-Score	0.98	0.99
Violent Recall	94%	97%
NonViolent Recall	100%	99%
